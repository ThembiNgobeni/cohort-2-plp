                <p>Hi, my name is Thembi Ngobeni. You might also know me as a web development student who is eagar to learn and solve the
                    world's charllenging issues using technology. I am also a Project Management graduate. For the past three years I have
                    working as a Business Advisor, and that has made me realize that many companies have challenges with both technical and
                    financial management issues and it got me thinking. Learning and studying computer programming was the best way for me  
                    to go about in order to bring solutions to the world and also fulfil my dreams.

                </p>
